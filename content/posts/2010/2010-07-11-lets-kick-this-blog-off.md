OK, I was convinced by Scott Hanselman's speech on social networking for developers ([Part 1](http://channel9.msdn.com/Shows/HanselminutesOn9/Hanselminutes-on-9-Social-Networking-for-Developers-Part-1-Every-Developer-Needs-a-Blog)Â and [Part 2](http://channel9.msdn.com/Shows/HanselminutesOn9/Hanselminutes-on-9-Social-Networking-for-Developers-Part-2-Make-your-Blog-Suck-Less)) so here it is.

Let's just see how long it lasts :)
