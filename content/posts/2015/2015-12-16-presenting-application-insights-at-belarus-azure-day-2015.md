I was talking about Application Insights and how it can help us get a better understanding of what's happing in our applications and how they are used. I demo'ed different kinds of events and correlation between them, built-in and custom metrics, client side and usage analytics and availability tests. I also covered integration aspects and how we can send our applications logs and traces to Application Insights so they become part of the whole telemetry that is gathered, analyzed and presented by the service.
